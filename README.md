I have removed the .env file for security reason.

All APIs are working with mongoDB connection as well.

These APIs can be used with any MONGO_URI in the .env file.

All controllers are defined in routes.js file

Schema.js file is for Model and conn.js is for Mongoose connection.

Index.js file is the main server file.

Project can be started with command "nodemon start".
